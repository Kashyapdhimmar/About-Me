## 🚀 About Me

I’m passionate about turning raw data into meaningful insights. With a background in customer service and a growing skill set in Excel, Power Query, and data visualization, I’m currently building a strong foundation in data analytics.

I recently created my **first interactive Excel dashboard** titled **"RetailMetrics Sales Analysis"**, which includes:

- Category-wise and Region-wise Transactions  
- Monthly Order Trends  
- Top Cities by Sales  
- Consumer Type and Shipping Mode Analysis  
- Fully Interactive Filters  

I'm now working on expanding my skills with tools like Power BI, SQL, and Python.
